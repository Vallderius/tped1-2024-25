                Snorkmaiden is a creative and excitable dreamer whose imagination comes in handy on adventures. She is very resourceful and quick-thinking, which often leads to her saving the day in style with a unique and ingenious solution. For example, she once rescued Moomintroll from a deep-sea octopus with nothing other than a ruby looking-glass. She enjoys acting out stories about beautiful maidens and brave heroes – with herself and Moomintroll in the leading roles, of course.
