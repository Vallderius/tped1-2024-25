                The Joxter is the laid-back spirit of adventure in Moominpappa’s Memoirs. A true free soul, he dreams of a perfect life spent lounging in fruit trees, eating whatever grows—no work, no worries. He’s wise in an unconventional way, with premonitions he calls “forebodings,” and a deep dislike for authority that even his son Snufkin inherits. At first glance he seems lazy and carefree, but he’s full of subtle mischief and unexpected loyalty. With him, every ordinary moment turns into a small adventure.
