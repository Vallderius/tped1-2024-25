                Sniff is something of a younger sibling to Moomintroll, having been adopted by the Moomin family at an early age. He is good-natured, loyal, excitable, and eager to join in any mission, but his taste for adventure is not often matched by his bravery… He dreams of finding riches and is particularly taken with the idea of owning anything sparkly or valuable.
