                Moominpappa thinks he’s a great thinker, a talented storyteller and a fearless traveler – and his family are always happy to indulge him! Moominmamma especially lets him play the hero and always welcomes his ‘help’ (even when others might consider it ‘interfering’…) Being a restless sort, Moominpappa occasionally longs for adventure or for something new and exciting to happen, but he is an honourable Moomin who always tries to fulfil his duties.
