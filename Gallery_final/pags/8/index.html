                Mymble is Little My’s big sister and an imaginative type – she is frequently to be found spinning stories and making up fantastical tales. From a young age she was often left in charge of her very many siblings, but that responsibility was too much for her carefree spirit! She much prefers her independent life in Moominvalley, where she is free to do as she pleases, finding delight in small pleasures and living in the moment.
